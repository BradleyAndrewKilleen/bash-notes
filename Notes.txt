Shell Parameter Expansion:

$ indicates parameter expansion, command substitution, or arithmetic expansion. Usually enclosed in braces to protect the variable from character immediately following it which could be interpreted as part of the name.

If the first character of the parameter is !, this intoduces indirection (known as indirect expansion).
